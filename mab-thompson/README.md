# Multi-Armed Bandit, Thompson Sampling

## What goes here?

Implementation of Thompson sampling for solving Multi-Armed Bandit. Another
focus being learning to work with effective sampling techniques so the
environment might change a bit.

## Environment

We will work with artificially generated Bernoulli Bandits.
